# 2022AI4SocietyDatathon: A Flow Problem

## Introduction and Background

In subsurface engineering applications, water injection into underground formations plays a pivotal role. A prime example is the extraction of geothermal energy, where the injection of cold water triggers the production of hot water from a different location. Similarly, this practice finds its application in oil and gas reservoir development as well as solution mining processes. The dynamics underlying this process are intricate, marked by highly nonlinear relationships among diverse variables. To streamline the complexity, we narrowed our focus to a simplified scenario encompassing single-phase water flow in an environment characterized by minimal compressibility and constant temperature. In essence, we delve into water injection and production challenges within a sandstone reservoir.

## Problem Statement

Welcome to the Subsurface Engineering Data Analysis competition! The crux of this competition lies in creating a data-driven model adept at predicting the flow rate of four specific producer wells—wells 19, 20, 24, and 25—over a span of 365 days. The key inputs encompass the unchanging, static attributes of the drilled location and the pressure time series. With a total of 61 wells at play, consisting of 36 water injectors and 25 producers, the intricacies of the task become apparent.

## Objective

The primary objective of this competition is to harness the power of data science to forecast the flow rates of the specified producer wells. This prediction is rooted in the reservoir's intrinsic characteristics and the historical production and injection data.

## Data Generation

### Reservoir Information

The stage is set with a shallow marine deposit, housing a sandstone reservoir. We assume a constant reservoir pressure of 33,095 kPa. The defining attributes at each well comprise the unvarying "static" properties:

- `Porosity`: Percentage of void space.
- `Permeability`: Governs fluid flow ease.
- `Thickness`: The reservoir's vertical extent.
- `X-coordinate`: Horizontal positioning.
- `Y-coordinate`: Lateral positioning.

### Operational Information

The injection pattern follows a 5-spot configuration. Noteworthy wells include numbers 19, 20, 24, and 25, boasting known pressure time series while their rate time series remain concealed. All other wells paint a different picture, unveiling both pressure and rate time series.

## Data Description

The dataset encompasses ten distinct reservoirs, earmarked for training (nine) and testing (one) purposes. Each reservoir's dataset entails:

- Static Data: `X-coordinate`, `Y-coordinate`, `porosity`, `permeability`, and `formation thickness`.
- Time Series Data: Each well's `flow rate` and `bottom hole pressure`. This data spans the 365-day timeframe, recorded daily.

## Model Description

To achieve more accurate predictions, we leverage the surrounding well's bottom hole pressure as an additional input to our model. This augmentation of input features allows us to capture more nuanced relationships within the data. To address the temporal nature of the problem, we employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of modelling sequences and time-dependent patterns. Using LSTM, we aim to simulate and predict the flow rates with enhanced accuracy and predictive power.

## Results
